basics:

 - easier char: Sukezaemon (ghost with red wing cap)
 - avoid running off track or touching the opponent.
   Skipping a checkpoint will also make you lose a lap.
 - some races you are taken to a bonus stage, where you have to race players and dodge a big black ball from squashing you. 
   One of the main goal of the bonus stages are to collect items, which you could use for later courses for your advantage.
   Winning or losing the bonus stage doesn't affect your winning streak.
 - once you have completed the first 7 stages, you have to face clones of yourself, which if you do lose in any place under 1st, you have to do the course again. If you do go to the ending and finished all of the courses, the endings vary what character you use, as they are all unique and different.
