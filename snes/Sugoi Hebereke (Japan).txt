basics:

 - easier char: Sukezaemon (ghost with red wing cap, has long range attacks, easy special moves: quick tap punch, 2xd-pad+kick to run away)
 - to win a match you have to knock out (KO) the other opponents, or be the last standing with more health when the timer runs out.
   Score 3 points and advance to the next battle.
 - each stage is square-shaped and has its own environmental hazards and moving objects ().
 - getting hit will deplete the blue gauge on the bottom-left.
 - you can collect various items during a battle:
   - Fruit of life = restore HP
   - skull = poison (can be passed to an enemy)
   - "P" = incr. attack power
   - "D" = incr. defese power
   - frisbee = incr. speed
   - "!" = easy special moves (just press punch or kick)
   - molotov cocktail = throw them with the kick button (they can damage yourself too)
   - "?" box = random event
