## Bomberman | Bomber Man

controls:

	d-pad = move
	A = drop a bomb
	B (with the detonator powerup) = detonate a bomb

basics:

 - to finish a stage you must kill all the enemies and find the exit hiddden in a block. 
   If the timer reaches 0, all enemies on the stage will be removed and replaced with 10 Pontans. Completing a stage will award you with an extra life (check the "LEFT" counter in the top-right).
 - you can also find 1 powerup hidden in each stage (no more than 1), which is kept in the following stages:
    - bomb = drop more than 1 bomb at a time
    - fire = range increase
    - heart = manual bombs denotator
    - skates = move faster
    - Wall Pass/bomb-walker
    - Bomb Pass/wall-walker
    - Fire Pass/flame-proof = permanent invicibility to bombs
    - question mark = temp. invicibility
 - do not bomb the exit or a powerup once it appear, because it will make more enemies appear.
 - every 5 stages you will play a BONUS STAGE where you are invincible and can kill enemies for extra points.
 - last STAGE: 50
